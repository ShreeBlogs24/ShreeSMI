# Gigabit Passive Optical Network (GPON) Chipset Market Overview

GPS anti-jamming protects GPS receivers from interference and intentional jamming. By the time the GPS signal reaches the earthâ€™s surface is weak and is susceptible to being overcome by higher power radio frequency (RF) energy. Even a small jammer of about 10 Watts power can disrupt an unprotected C/A code receiver for about 30 kilometres (line of sight). GPS anti-jamming uses power minimization to reduce the effect of interference and jamming so that the GPS receiver can continue to operate correctly.
