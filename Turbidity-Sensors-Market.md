# Turbidity Sensors Market Overview

Turbidity Sensors measure light passing through a sample of water. The light transmitted through the sample is dependent on the amount of soiled particles in the water. These devices are ideally suited for use in washing machines & dishwashers as well as other water purity type applications. As the particles increase, the light transmitted decreases. The measurement produced by the turbidity sensors enables the machine to run for shorter periods, generating energy savings for the consumer and long term environmental benefits.
